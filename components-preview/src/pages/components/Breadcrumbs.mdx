# Breadcrumbs

This UI library was created to full a niche in my other project [Neutrino-Chat](https://github.com/maeek/).

### Usage
<Playground>
  <div className="display-container">
    <Breadcrumbs
      separatorNode={<span>&</span>}
      onClick={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
      rel="noopener norefferer"
      anchorTarget="_blank"
      theme="light"
      crumbs={[
        {text: 'root', href: '/'},
        {text: 'backuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuups', href: '/backups/'},
        {
          text: 'documents',
          href: '/backups/#create-space',
          node: (
            <ButtonBasic className="button" icon={<AddRoundedIcon />}>
              Create space
            </ButtonBasic>
          )
        }
      ]}
    />
  </div>
